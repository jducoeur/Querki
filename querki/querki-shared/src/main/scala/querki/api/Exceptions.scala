/**
 * The base class for "semantic API exceptions" -- that is, well-behaved Exceptions that
 * are considered to be part of the Querki API. The entry points that can throw these should
 * document them, and the Client should handle them properly.
 *
 * The Querki APIs *can* result in other Exceptions. Client code should handle those on a
 * best-effort basis, but generally consider them to be internal errors, at least in the sense
 * that we have failed to properly encapsulate an error from the input.
 *
 * All exceptions will be returned from the API as BadRequest (400) returns, with the exception
 * serialized (in standard uPickle format) as the body of the result.
