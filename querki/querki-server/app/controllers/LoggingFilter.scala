/**
 * General filter that permits extensive logging of all requests. Adapted from example found in
 * Play documentation:
 * 
 *   http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/ScalaHttpFilters
 *   
 * Basically, when querki.test.logAllRequests is set to true, we show the requests, the results,
 * and how long they took.
 * 
 * TODO: this probably must be modified for production use before GA, simply for security reasons:
 * it leaks too much user info into the logs. The request side *may* be okay, but the result side
 * certainly is not.
