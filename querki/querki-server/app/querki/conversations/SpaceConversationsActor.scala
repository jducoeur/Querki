/**
 * The SpaceConversationActor manages the Conversations for one specific Space. Its lifespan is basically the
 * same as the Space itself -- it is created when the Space is, and shuts down when the Space is unloaded.
 * Unlike the Space, though, it does not keep all the Conversations in memory all the time: it loads and unloads
 * them as needed.
 * 
 * Note that this Actor is an especially good candidate to become an EventSourcedProcessor. We really should rework
 * it at some point, replacing the persister with Akka Persistence.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: this implies that all changes should happen in EventSourced style, to make the evolution easier when it
 * happens. We should receive a Command, validate that Command, and then persist an Event that makes the actual change
 * to the state.
