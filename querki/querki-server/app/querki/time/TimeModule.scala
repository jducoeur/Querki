/**
 * The TimeModule is responsible for all things Time-related in the Querki API.
 * 
 * Conceptually, it is a fairly thin layer over Joda-time -- Joda is pretty clean and
 * well-built, so we may as well adapt from it. When in doubt, use Joda's conceptual
 * structure.
 * 
 * As of this writing, the methods are all in System, but that should probably change:
 * I expect us to expose a *lot* of methods and types through this Module. So in the
 * medium term, most of it should become an opt-in Mixin, with only the most essential
 * methods in System. (This will likely require us to split this Module into two, which
 * should be fine.)

            |
            |At the moment, the only way to get a DateTime is through the _modTime function, which
            |produces the DateTime when the given Thing was last changed.
            |
            |ADVANCED: under the hood, DateTimes are based on the [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/)
            |library, and you can use Joda-Time format strings when displaying a DataTime. For example,
            |if you say:
            |```
            |\[[My Thing -> _modTime -> \""\__KK:mm MMM dd 'yy\__\""\]]
            |```
            |it will display as something like "09:24 Mar 10 '96".
            |
            |In the long time, we will probably add functions corresponding to most of the capabilities
            |of Joda-Time. If there are specific functions or features that you need, please ask for them.
            |
            |There is no UI for entering DateTime values yet. (At least, not one that real people
            |can use.) For that reason, Date and Time Type is currently marked as Internal -- you can't
            |create a Data and Time Property yet. This will change in the future: if DateTimes are
            |important to your use case, please say so, and we may prioritize it higher.""".stripMargin)
