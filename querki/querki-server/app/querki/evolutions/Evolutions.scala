/**
 * The main API for Space Evolutions.
 * 
 * Evolutions deal with the issue of altering the schema of Spaces. We don't want to do that as a single
 * big push, because it would potentially take a devastating amount of time -- there are potentially
 * millions of tables to update. So instead, we focus on evolving each Space at load-time.
 * 
 * The high concept here is lifted from Play's evolution system. We have a number of individual
 * "steps", in numeric order. When we find that a Space is behind the current version number, we
 * run it through those steps to bring it up to the current time.
 * 
 * This currently runs synchronously while the Space is loading. That's not necessarily optimal:
 * it's putting a lot of dangerous work inside the Space's preload. In the medium term, we might
 * refactor Space load to be more step-wise, with evolution as an early step in that process. (This
 * would also allow us to show progress messages as it is happening.)
 * 
 * To add a Step, simply create it in querki.evolutions.steps (make sure its version is set!), and
 * add it to stepList below.
