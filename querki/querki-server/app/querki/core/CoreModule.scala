            |    for a Thing to have the Property but not have it filled in. It is very common for a Model to have an
            |    Optional Property, which its Instances can choose to fill in when it makes sense.

            |* Set -- the Property holds an unordered set of this Type. You most often use Set with Tags. Duplicates
