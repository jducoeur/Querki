/**
 * Represents a "plug-in" part of the system.
 * 
 * An Ecot is a collection of Properties, Things, Listeners and (typically) some code to
 * integrate with specialized libraries, which adds a particular kind of capability to
 * Querki.
 * 
 * This is the base class that should usually be used to instantiate Ecots in Querki. It
 * adds a large number of convenience methods that shadow types and calls that get used
 * frequently, to reduce the number of boilerplate imports.
 * 
 * ==Building an Ecot==
 * 
 * An Ecot will typically includes a number of Thing definitions -- these *must* be declared
 * as lazy vals, and referenced in an overridden types, props or things (as appropriate).
 * 
 * And init-time dependencies that this Ecot requires (including Properties used in the
 * constructors of those Things) must be declared as *NON*-lazy vals using initRequires().
