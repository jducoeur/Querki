/**
 * A SpacePlugin allows external Ecots to add specialized messages that each Space can handle.
 * This is mainly for separation of concerns, so that the Space can be used as a synchronization
 * point without having to know about the entire world.
 * 
 * Extend this class to create your specific plugin.
 * 
 * ==Rules for SpacePlugins==
 * - Only use a SpacePlugin if you have a chunk of code that ''must'' happen inside the Space processing,
 *   SpacePlugins are automatically a little expensive, even if they are rarely invoked. They are
 *   mainly intended for crucial synchronization situations.
 * - The SpacePlugin's receive function must be '''fast''', and must '''never''' block. It may send
 *   messages, and handle responses, for asynchronous processing.
 * - The SpacePlugin must be self-contained. It will be owned by the Space itself, and will be discarded
 *   when the Space is unloaded.
 * - The receive method should avoid throwing Exceptions if possible; if they happen, they will force
 *   a reload of the Space, and the message will be dropped on the floor, as usual for receive.
