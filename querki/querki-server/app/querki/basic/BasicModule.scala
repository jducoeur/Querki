          |very advanced, and are not recommended for anyone aside from programmers.
          |
          |Technically, a Function is simply an "inside-out" Large Text Property, containing the stuff that
          |would normally go inside square brackets -- a single QL expression of arbitrary complexity. It is
          |not often strictly necessary to pull code out into a Function, but is occasionally the only way to
          |deal with a complex problem such as recursion, and is often helpful for factoring a complex expression.
          |
          |Note that QL and QText can contain each other, to a nearly arbitrary level of recursion. Just as a Text
          |Property can contain QL expressions in double-square-brackets, a Function can contain QText in
          |double-double-quotes.
          |
          |When a Function is invoked from a QL expression, it receives the passed-in context (the value on the
          |left-hand side of the "->"), and that will be received by the first stage of this Function. The received
          |context can also be accessed from anywhere in the Function, as $\_context. If the Function is called with
          |parameters in parentheses, those can be used as $\_1, $\_2, etc.
          |
          |Functions are still pretty new, and it is not clear that all of the kinks have been ironed out yet.
          |If you encounter behaviour that seems to be wrong, please ask about it, and feel free to log an Issue
          |if you find a bug.
          |
          |In the future, Functions will be **greatly** enhanced. Among other things, we plan to add:
          |* Named parameters
          |* The ability to declare a Function Signature, specifying the legal Types for the context and params
          |* The ability to specify the return Type of the Function
          |* Name bindings for values (basically, the immutable version of variables)
          |* Mechanisms for changing the Space programmatically
          |* Type inference, which will attempt to automatically detect the signature and return Type
          |
          |That is all down the road, however -- for now, a Function is simply a raw block of code, with no
          |type checking, so use them with care. If you need specific language features, please ask.""".stripMargin)

          |the most important Property in Querki, and advanced users may want to play with it.
          |
          |One of Querki's design goals was that it should Just Work. This is reflected, more than anywhere else,
          |in the fact that you can just say:
          |[[_code(""[[My Thing]]"")]]
          |and it shows up as a pointer to *My Thing*.
          |
          |That seems obvious, but consider -- you can also say:
          |[[_code(""[[My Property]]"")]]
          |and what you get isn't a pointer to *My Property* -- instead, you get the *value* of My Property on the
          |Thing you're looking at.
          |
          |Moreover, you can say:
          |[[_code(""[[All Things]]"")]]
          |on a page, and what you get is a listing of all of the Things in this Space! So what the heck is going on
          |here?
          |
          |The secret behind the magic is the _apply method. _apply is a Property that is defined on *every* Thing.
          |(More or less -- system-defined Things use a closely-related built-in mechanism.) It defines exactly
          |"What should happen when I name this Thing?" So _apply on Properties displays the value of the Property
          |on the received Thing; _apply on All Things is this QL Expression:
          |[[_code(All Things._apply)]]
          |And _apply for Thing (the Model that everything is based on) simply produces a pointer to this thing.
          |
          |You can define _apply for your own Things as well -- indeed, the way you usually write your own serious
          |Methods is to define a Thing that just has an _apply Property, and then you can use the Method just like
          |the system-defined ones, by name.
          |
          |The QL Expression in the _apply Property will receive whatever is passed in, and should produce whatever
          |you want to pass out. It is currently completely unstructured and untyped. However, note that we will
          |probably be moving towards more structure in the future, and you should always try to be consistent:
          |as with any QL Expression, you should expect to receive a specific Type, and always produce a specific Type.""".stripMargin)))
