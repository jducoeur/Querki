          |so you often don't even need to bother.
          |
          |If parameters are given, they are applied to each element in LIST, and the results are used to sort the
          |elements. The sort order is whatever is natural for the returned elements -- usually alphabetical, but might be, for example,

          |ExactlyOne value. (If it returns a List, only the first will be used. The behaviour is undefined if it returns a Set, or None.)
          |
          |If you need to sort on multiple fields, list them as additional parameters. For example, if you have
          |```
          |LIST -> _sort(A, B, C) -> SORTED
          |```

          |C, and so on.

          |_sort is focused on Things, and as mentioned above, will default to sorting those by Name. You can also sort lists of Numbers,

                |of the common functional-programming function fold().
                |
                |Basically, this receives a List, and takes two parameters: an initial value and
                |an expression. It runs through the List, one element at a time, building up an
                |"accumulator". Each time through, you get the current accumulator and the next
                |element; the expression should result in a new value, which will become the
                |new accumulator.
                |
                |The accumulator is passed into the expression as the bound name `$acc`; the next
                |element as `$next`.
                |
                |It is best understood through an example. This is how you would implement "sum"
                |using `_fold`:
                |
                |```
                |<1, 2, 3, 4> -> _fold(0, $acc -> _plus($next))
                |```
                |
                |That is, you can think of a sum as simply adding all of the elements together
                |one at a time. So you start with 0 (the first parameter). The first time it
                |calls the expression, `$acc` is 0 and `$next` is 1 (the first element of the List),
                |so it results in 1. Next time around, `$acc` is 1 and `$next` is 2 (the next element),
                |so it results in 3. Then it adds 3 and 3 to get 6; then it adds 6 and 4, to get 10.
                |
                |For convenience, the value of `$acc` is also given at the context of the expression.
                |So you could actually express the above even more concisely as:
                |
                |```
                |<1, 2, 3, 4> -> _fold(0, _plus($next))
